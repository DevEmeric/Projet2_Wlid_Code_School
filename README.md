This is a game made in React and a lot of CSS, with a Harry Potter theme.

On this project, i specifically made : 

//src/scripts/Fighter.js // this component displays the two fighters, with there corresponding styles.
It is also in charge of creating an array of the onKeyPress event, in order to allow both fighters to be
able to move in the same time.

//src/scripts/Instructions.js // this component displays the controls and pause the game.
